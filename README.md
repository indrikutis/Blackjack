## Blackjack

## Goal:
The purpose of a game is to have a hand that totals higher than the dealer's, but doesn't total higher than 21.

## Terminology:
1. Hit - action, when you wish a dealer to give you another card
2. Stand - action to stop drawing cards
3. Bust - when the total points of a hand exceed 21

## Game:
# Game setup

The game contains a number of players and a dealer.

1. Everyone besides a dealer places a bet.
2. The dealers deals 1 card face-up to all players and 1 card face up to themselves.
3. The dealers deals 1 more card face-up to all players and deals 1 card face-down to themselves.

# Game rules

1. If the two face-up cards total 21, the player automatically wins 1.5 times the bet from the dealer and is done for the round.
2. If the player doesn't total 21, player can hit or stand. There is no limit to how many cards the player can have.
3. When the dealer has gone around the table, they flip their second, face-down card. If the total is 16 or under, the dealer has to take another card. If it's 17 or higher, they have to stay with their hand. If the dealer busts, every player in the round wins twice their bet.
4. If the dealer doesn't bust, only players that have a hand higher than the dealers win twice their bet and everyone else looses their initial bet.
5. When the round is over, a new round begins.

# Points system:
-   Number cards are worth their face value (2-10) 
-	Jacks, queens, and kings are worth 10 each
-	Aces are worth either 1 or 11 (player chooses)

## Assumptions

1. Every player starts with 5 chips and the dealer has 10000 chips (consider this is as an unlimited number of chips).
